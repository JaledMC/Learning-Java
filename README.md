# Learning-Java
Some Java newbie exercises from Udacity [**Java Programming Basics**](https://mena.udacity.com/course/java-programming-basics--ud282) and [**Object Oriented Programming in Java**](https://eu.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-programming-in-java--ud283), to open the mind and do some OOP code. Both are very good courses with very good teachers, and **FREE!**. All code and descriptions come fom their exercises and I don't claim any authorship.

# [HelloWorld](https://github.com/JaledMC/Learning-Java/tree/master/HelloWorld):
This project doesn't need any explanation.

# [Car](https://github.com/JaledMC/Learning-Java/tree/master/car): 
Program that stores a list of cars with their plate number, km, model and brand.
 
# [Exercies](https://github.com/JaledMC/Learning-Java/tree/master/execises):  
Some easy code methods mix to train.

# [Notebook](https://github.com/JaledMC/Learning-Java/tree/master/notebook):  
Save the name, email and phone number of your contacts

# [Chess](https://github.com/JaledMC/Learning-Java/tree/master/Chess):  
This is not a chess game (I wish). Only a toy example with a rock piece to move it around the board limits.

# [DiceGame](https://github.com/JaledMC/Learning-Java/tree/master/DiceGame):  
Random game where two dices rolls. If both of them have same number, you win. You have only 4 attemps.  

# [GuessMovie](https://github.com/JaledMC/Learning-Java/tree/master/GuessMovie): 
The player gets to guess the movie name given the number of letters in it (pretty much like hangman). The computer randomly picks a movie title, and shows you how many letters it's made up of. Your goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time. If a letter is indeed in the title the computer will reveal its correct position in the word, if not, you lose a point. If you lose 10 points, game over!  

# [SpaceX](https://github.com/JaledMC/Learning-Java/tree/master/SpaceX):   
Simulation program to test two rockets models for a space mission to Mars. Both of them have to carry a list of items: habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers.  

The U-1 Rocket modle is light weight, agile and pretty safe, but can only carry a total of 18 tonnes of cargo. It costs $100 Million to build and weighs 10 tonnes. It has a slim chance of crashing while landing but a bigger chance of exploding when launching, both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried in the rocket. 
  
The U2 Rocket model is heavier than the U-1 but much safer and can carry a lot more cargo; to a total of 29 tonnes. However, it costs $120 Million to build and weighs 18 tonnes. It has a greater chance of crashing while landing than while launching, but just like the U-1 both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried.  

The mission consists of 2 phases: the phase 1 is meant to send building equipment and construction material to help build the colony, saved in a text file that contains the list of all items with their weight, Phase-1.txt. The phase 2 is meant to send the colony of humans along with some food resources, and, as the phase 1, has a file Phase-1.txt for it.
